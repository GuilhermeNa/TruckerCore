     * This method is called within the transactional block of a Firestore operation.

     * ### Example usage:
     * ```kotlin
     * val instruction: FirebaseInstruction = FirebaseSet(
     *     instructionTag = InstructionTag("user_create"),
     *     document = firestore.collection("users").document(),
     *     data = UserDto("Alice", email = "alice@example.com")
     * )
     *
     * firestore.runTransaction { transaction ->
     *     instruction.execute(transaction)
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * @param transaction The Firestore transaction in which the operation should be performed.
